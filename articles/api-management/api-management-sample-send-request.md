## Summary
Azure API Management service provides an ideal place to capture the HTTP traffic travelling to and from your APIs. Azure Event Hubs is a highly scalable, low cost solution for capturing that traffic and feeding it into secondary processing systems for logging, monitoring and other sophisticated analytics.  Connecting to 3rd party traffic monitoring systems like Runscope is a simple as a few dozen lines of code.
